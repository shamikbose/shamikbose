### Hi there 👋
I'm Shamik and I enjoy building solutions to problems, mostly through programming (and occasionally with WD-40). I work as a Lead Data Scientist building machine learning applications for detecting and anonymizing PII and PHI in data breaches. I am also a part-time contributor to the [BigScience Workshop](https://github.com/bigscience-workshop) and the [BigBIO](https://github.com/bigscience-workshop/biomedical) efforts from [🤗](https://huggingface.co/). In addition, I am working with [PIISA](https://github.com/piisa), a collection of data scientists, software developers and lawyers to establish an open standard for PII protection that can be used across the globe. You can follow our efforts [here](https://privacyprotection.substack.com/). I also like to cook 👨‍🍳
